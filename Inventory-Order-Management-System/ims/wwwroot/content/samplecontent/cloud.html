        Cloud computing has already proven worthy of attention from established enterprises and start-ups alike. Most businesses are looking at cloud computing with more than just idle curiosity. As of this writing, IT market research suggests that most enterprise IT managers have enough resources to adopt cloud computing in combination with on-premises IT capabilities.

        Of course, there are people who are skeptical of cloud computing’s ability to deliver on the promises. This emerging solution is almost analogous to the creation of ARPANET (precursor to Internet); many skeptical research institutions didn’t want to join the initial network for fear of losing their private data. Once scientists saw the benefits of data networking and the collaboration it enabled, there was no stopping them, and the rest is history. Today’s large enterprises, like the ARPANET skeptics, are in the process of getting acquainted with the paradigm shift that is occurring in how computing capabilities are acquired and operated.
