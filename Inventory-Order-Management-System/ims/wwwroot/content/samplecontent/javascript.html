       JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript (the untrademarked name used for the standard), is a dynamic programming language.
       It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user,
       control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.
       It is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

        JavaScript is also used in environments that aren't web-based, such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets.
        Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications.
        On the client side, JavaScript has been traditionally implemented as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform just-in-time compilation.
