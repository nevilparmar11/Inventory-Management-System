       Big data is a broad term for data sets so large or complex that traditional data processing applications are inadequate. 
       Challenges include analysis, capture, data curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, and information privacy.
       The term often refers simply to the use of predictive analytics or other certain advanced methods to extract value from data, and seldom to a particular size of data set.
       Accuracy in big data may lead to more confident decision making. And better decisions can mean greater operational efficiency, cost reductions and reduced risk.

      In today's data-driven world, managing large quantities of data has become an important ingredient in business success. Managing big data comes with several challenges, including cost-effective storage and querying across structured and unstructured data. It also offers tremendous potential. 
      Imagine not having to decide which of your data is valuable. Imagine being able to store any amount of data using commodity hardware with linear scalability. The Hadoop environment makes all of this, and much more, possible today.
      And now, Syncfusion has made these powerful technologies available on Windows. 
      With the Syncfusion Big Data Platform, you have complete access to the Hadoop environment. By adopting our platform, you are using an industry-tested solution currently employed by companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, Hulu, LinkedIn, and Yahoo.
