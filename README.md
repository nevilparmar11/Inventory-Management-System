## Inventory and Order Management System
#### [Software Requirements Document [SRS]](https://github.com/nevilparmar11/Inventory-Management-System/blob/main/Documentation/Inventory_Management_System_CE092.pdf)

This system provides any firm a functionality that enables them to keep a track of their goods and orders across the supply chain. It also plays a vital role in taking care of small business needs including sales and accounting, and can even help multiple users to handle their workflow efficiently. The admin can manage multiple users and assign them appropriate role and permissions to work parallelly in the system. The firm can manage/store their vendor, shipment, bill, customers, and warehouse records which in turn gets processed by the system to get an analytical view of their progress in the market, and the system can alert/suggest at an apt time.

The system is mainly divided into 5 modules.
1. Sales
- Deals with the data of sales of various products of the inventory.
2. Purchase
- Deals with the data of purchase of various products of the inventory
3. Inventory
- Deals with the products available in the inventory
4. Config
- So this module plays a vital role in terms implementation and feature reachability. Using features provided by this module the firm can make the system more reliable and efficient according to their needs and priority and can take the maximum advantage of it.
5. Users and Roles
- The last but not the least. This module deals with different users of the system. As mentioned in the SRS, we have categorized the users into 2 categories. Admin and Employees. Employees could be the user who work with the system in the limit of permissions granted by the admin.
- Also , admin can take the full ownership of the system and can change the assigned roles to any user along with other tweaks of the system.
