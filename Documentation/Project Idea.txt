The goal is to develop an Inventory management system that provides any firm a functionality that enables them to keep a track of their goods and orders across the supply chain. It also plays a vital role in taking care of small business needs including sales and accounting, and can even help multiple users to handle their workflow efficiently. The firm can manage/store their vendor, shipment, bill, customers, and warehouse records which in turn gets processed by the system to get an analytical view of their progress in the market, and the system can alert/suggest at an apt time.
